Messaging Application - State Design Pattern

This application demonstrates the State design pattern to control the behavior of a messaging application with user accounts. The application allows you to send messages to user accounts, and the State design pattern is used to manage the state transitions and behavior of the user accounts.

Implementation of the State Design Pattern
State Interface (MessageState.java):
The MessageState interface defines methods to represent different states and their behaviors.
The interface includes methods for sending messages and receiving messages.

Concrete State Classes:
NewMessageState: Represents the state when a message is received but not yet read.
ReadMessageState: Represents the state when a message has been read by the user account.
UnreadMessageState: Represents the state when a new message is received, and the user account has unread messages.
NoMessageState: Represents the state when there are no messages for the user account.

Context Class (UserAccount.java):
The UserAccount class serves as the context in which user accounts operate.
It maintains the current state and delegates message sending and receiving operations to the current state.
The UserAccount class allows changing the current state based on message handling.

Main Class (Main.java):
The Main class contains the main method and demonstrates the behavior of the messaging application and user accounts.
It creates user accounts and simulates sending and receiving messages, showing transitions between different message states.

Test Class (MessagingAppTest.java):
The MessagingAppTest class contains test cases to verify the behavior of the messaging application and user accounts in different message states.
It ensures that the state transitions and message handling occur as expected.

Building and Running the Application
Ensure you have Apache Ant and Ivy installed.
Navigate to the project directory containing the build.xml file.

Building the Application
Run ant compile: This compiles the main code.
Run ant test-compile: This compiles the test code.
Run ant run: This compiles both the main and test code and runs the application.

Running Tests
Run ant test: This executes JUnit tests.

By following the State design pattern, this messaging application allows user accounts to transition between different message states and handle messages effectively. Users can send and receive messages, and the application ensures that messages are appropriately managed based on their states.
